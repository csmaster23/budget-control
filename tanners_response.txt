Response to budget-control

I love this idea for the simple reason that I am also looking for a budget service that is simple and customizable. I feel like I can help with my background in Progress OpenEdge database knowledge. I also have been developing an iOS mobile application and have just done my own backend on my own server just a few weeks ago, so I am fresh with all that knowledge which is beneficial.

Business:
I love how you want to make the service simple and elegant. I think there are some financial options out there that are too complicated and they donâ€™t have what I want. I thnk building something simple and elegant is a great goal. Also, making it free is a bonus in my opinion.

Legal:
I like that it is free. The legal stuff can get too complicated.

Technical:
On the relational database side, I also have knowledge with PSQL which is one of the forms he mentioned we can use. It is really simple and easy. If you decide to use that one I have experience and some old cold regarding that database.
